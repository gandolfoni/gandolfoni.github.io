    <h1><strong>Echoes of The Constellar</strong></h1>
    <pre>
      "I have seen worlds bathed in the Makers' flames. Their denizens fading
      without so much as a whimper. Entire planetary systems born and raised in
      the time that it takes your mortal hearts to beat once. Yet all
      throughout, my own heart, devoid of emotion... of empathy.

      I... have... felt... NOTHING!
      
       A million, million lives wasted.
        Had they all held within them your tenacity?
        Had they all loved life as you do? 
        Perhaps it is your imperfection that which grants you free will. 
        That allows you to persevere against cosmically calculated odds. 
        You prevailed where the Titans' own perfect creations have failed."

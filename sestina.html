        <h1><u>Some Day Soon</u></h1>

        <pre>
        The idea that at some point in the future
        My name will be mentioned for the last time 
        I'm just a blip on the timeline of man 
        Destined to be forever forgotten 
        I was unable to complete my life goal
        Failing to live by making history

        Perhaps it's eighty years dull history 
        That makes my past, present and my future 
        Spent aimlessly wandering with no goal 
        Willingly wasting my precious brief time 
        Missing my chance to not be forgotten 
        Ever overlooked by the best of all man 

        Someday soon there will be no living man
        Able to confirm my slim history
        On that day I'll truly be forgotten 
        Consumed by the promising new future 
        Vanishing from memory and space time 
        To prevent this grim fate is life's main goal 

        Admire and respect religions goal 
        Emulating the perfect humble man 
        Made by the creator of all known time 
        From early dawn of our species' history 
        Including the past, present, and future 
        Religious laws easily forgotten 
        
        Although I lack faith, nothing's forgotten 
        Religions help achieve mans distant goal 
        Immortality into the future 
        So that his name is known by every man 
        His legacy encompass' history 
        His praises sung long after his mortal time 
        
        Who can know what happens when out of time 
        One can only avoid the forgotten 
        Strive for their own chapter of history 
        Achieve much in life, despite no true goal 
        Focus on your duty to fellow man 
        Rather than the uncertain dark future 

        Even if my vision of the future 
        Is of typical delusional man 
        I will still achieve my brief life's main goal
